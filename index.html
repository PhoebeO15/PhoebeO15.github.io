<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Phoebe, and I am going to be a high school junior. I'll be turning 16 years old this December. I've always been interested in engineering since I was young due to the early exposure that I was given to hands-on building I was able to get from tinkercrates, a subscription kit that had many different levels of kits for each age that came with parts of things that you have to put together and build yourself (with instructions of course! :)  Having this growing upsparked my interest in the engineering field not only with the hands-on aspects but also leading to me wanting to try out the computer/programming side of engineering. Which has led me to joing the KKCF program that has helped me to learn more about HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Growing my desire for a job in this field.</p>
